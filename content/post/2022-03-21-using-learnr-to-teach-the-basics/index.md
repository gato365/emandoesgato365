# Designing an Activity with learnr & grader

This is not for the faint... It is not hard if you already know the ins and outs of R markdown but the level of creativity is on a different level.


Advice before getting started

1. Know what you are going to talk about before hand
2. List out all your thoughts before coding
3. Think of questions that you would want your students to answer and write them down as you go along
4. Open-Ended Questions are the best but we are not there yet
5.
