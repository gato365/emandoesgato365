### 1. What?
Introducing data science & programming to high school may seem daunting but it does not have to be.

Using the right environment and data, can ensure student engagement  and comprehension

I have created a learning module to introduce elements of data science to high school students.

The purpose of this activity is to get students excited about the field of data science while having them interact with real data. A part


### 2. Why?
This is important because skills within data science and programming are becoming more and more important not only in the job field but also in higher education.

### 3. How?

Teachers must first prompt the class that they are going to learn about data science today.

Either a student will ask, what is data science or you can ask the class what is data science?

This can be answered by either saying or evaluating an answer: "using data to make decisions". Thats it! We can make it more complicated but it does not have to be when you are trying to get students excited about field.

"What kind of decisions?" You may ask them or they may ask you. Any decision. You should then inform them that they're going to learn the following topics about data:

- how data is stored? 
- common tools to help make decisions.
- visualize the data

#### Tab 1: Data Frame
- explanation and  what they students 
- general comments:

#### Tab 2: Filter (tool 1)
- explanation and what they students 
- general comments:


#### Tab 3: Select (tool 2)
