# Instructions:
Go through this post and implement the same strategy to summarize your data as post does for the *mtcars* data frame. You will need to install a package called 'kableExtra' which is used to make tables look aesthetically pleasing within R. Make the appropriate interpretations of your summary statistics as you create them.



```r
library(tidyverse)
```

```
## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.1 ──
```

```
## ✓ ggplot2 3.3.5     ✓ purrr   0.3.4
## ✓ tibble  3.1.6     ✓ dplyr   1.0.8
## ✓ tidyr   1.2.0     ✓ stringr 1.4.0
## ✓ readr   2.1.2     ✓ forcats 0.5.1
```

```

## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

##     group_rows
```




You should modify your data in the same way that you did in the last post to be able to visualize the data here. I did so for the *mtcars* data frame (made cyl into a factor and changed the level names for the transmission variable).

```r
mod1_mtcars <- mtcars %>% 
  mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl),
         am = case_when(
           am == 1 ~ 'manual',
           am == 0 ~ 'automatic'
         ))
```

## General Approach
Remember the purpose of Two-Way ANOVA is to test for three different effects on the response variable:

1. Explanatory Variable 1
2. Explanatory Variable 2
3. The Interaction between both explanatory variables 

In this example, the response variable is *mpg* and the explanatory variables are *cyl* (number of cylinders) and *am* (transmission type). It is imperative that you evaluate the visualizations and summary statistics before you implement any test (Friday's Post).

```r
mod1_mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(`Sample Mean Cyl` = mean(mpg, na.rm = TRUE),
            `Sample SD Cyl` = sd(mpg, na.rm = TRUE),
            `Sample Size` = n()) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling() %>% 
  footnote('Cyl denotes the Cylinder')
```

#### Interpretation
- The basic interpretation of this summary was done within One-Way ANOVA in that the sample mean of 
*mpg* decreases as the number of cylinders increases.
- It is also important to note when the number of cylinders is 4
 the standard deviation is the greatest and is the smallest when the number of cylinders is 6
- The sample size is not equal across the number of cylinders

### Summary of 1 of the Explanatory Variables: Transmission
=======
Notice how I used the abbreviated Cyl in the name of the description of the variable. I also provided a footnote that states what Cyl means. Abbreviate your explanatory variable to make the table look nice. (In order to add the footnote you must download and run 'kableExtra').
