# What do the students learn from these presentations?

- Learn about what is data science and data science relates to the real world
- Experience how data science works in various applications (i.e., entertainment, sports,  eSports, fashion)
- The importance of data visualizations
- How mathematics, statistics, and programming contribute to answering questions using data science
- What students can do now to prepare for data science in college



# What experience I have with data science and teaching?

- When I was graduate school, I noticed there can be a lot done with data. I started to extract data from websites and simply plot relationships between variables I thought would be interesting. This is when I got hooked! Around the same time I began teaching statistics and wanted to link my passion for data to classroom. Therefore, I found various opportunities for me to give talks at high schools, colleges, and even to middle school students regarding what can be done with data science. 

My topics ranged included:

- Billboard Top 100 Chart
- Comparing NBA Legends
- Demographics Across Cities



## Plot of Comparing Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, & LeBron James

## GIF Billboard  


## Pictures of Me
 - SLO high in 2019
 - SLO high in 2021
 - CSUMB on stage
 - Working with Students (in 2021 on CP campus)

# How is the presentation interactive?

- Use Web Applications to create their own plots to justify their answers (PFS)
- Use web application to perform statistical analyses (Demographics of Cities)
