As I am writing this post, I am listening to *Lazy Afternoon* by the Roots and I 
am reminiscencing my college years. Those were the days! But on a different note
I would like to analyze how The Roots changed in terms of  their music regarding one of their
first albums (Do You Want More?!!!??! - 1995) to one of their most recent albums (Undun  - 2011).

Did Jimmy Fallon change one of my favorite hip artist groups?

They were not on Jimmy Fallon's show until
