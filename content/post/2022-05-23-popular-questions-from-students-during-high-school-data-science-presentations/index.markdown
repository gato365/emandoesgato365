After giving more than 6 data science presentations in California these are some common questions I have received as well as my answers. I hope to post more solutions in the future!


## **Q1. How do you use data science?**


### In my classroom
I use data science in my classroom to give students performance reports. Below is an example of how a student compared with their classmates.

### In my life
I use data science to evaluate many aspects of my life. Below is a graph of my weight back in 2019.

Another example of using data science in my life is by tracking my goals throughout the week.

## **Q2. Are there communities for women in data science?**

There are plenty of opportunities for women in data science. Here are a few places to gain more information regarding communities that promote women in data science ,[R ladies](https://rladies.org/) and 
[Women in data science conference](https://www.widsconference.org/).

## **Q3. What programming language should be used for data science?**

**Python hands down**, however, R is a great place to start and R studio (a place to program R code) allows you to program in R and python. R is a great beginner language. The community is friendly and their are many free resources to learn data science.
